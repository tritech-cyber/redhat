Passive FTP (sometimes referred to as PASV FTP because it involves 
the FTP PASV command) is a more secure form of data transfer in which 
the flow of data is set up and initiated by the File Transfer Program (FTP) client 
rather than by the FTP server program. Separate FTP client programs, such as WS_FTP Pro, 
usually allow the user to select passive FTP. 
Most Web browsers (which act as FTP clients) use passive FTP by default 
because corporations prefer it as a safety measure. As a general rule, 
any coprorate firewall server, which exists in order to protect an 
internal network from the outside world, recognizes input from the 
outside only in response to user requests that were sent out 
requesting the input. 
The use of passive FTP ensures all data flow initiation comes 
from inside the network rather than from the outside.
