openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout /etc/pki/tls/private/httpd.key -x509 -days 365 -out /etc/pki/tls/certs/httpd.crt

ls -l /etc/pki/tls/private/httpd.key /etc/pki/tls/certs/httpd.crt

/etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf file with administrative privileges and change the following lines:

FROM:
SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt
SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/private/localhost.key
TO:
SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/httpd.crt
SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/private/httpd.key


As an optional step redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.

T do so create a new file /etc/httpd/conf.d/redirect_http.conf with a following content:

<VirtualHost _default_:80>
        Servername rhel8
        Redirect permanent / https://rhel8/
</VirtualHost>
